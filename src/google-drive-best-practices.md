# Google Drive Best Practices
Last Updated 4/25/2018

### TL;DR
_Fill out section with general best practices_

- least permissions as possible
- fewest people as possible
- smallest scope possible (share docs individually if possible)
- better to give more permissions than have to roll them back
- something about account ownership

### Sharing new documents
In order to access any sharing options for your document, click the "Share" button in the top bar of google drive.

The first mistake you could make is clicking on “Get shareable link”

This will generate a link that anyone, even those outside of the
organization can view. If you modify the dropdown below marked “Anyone
with the link **can view**”, you could be giving anyone in the world the
ability to modify your document.

There are good reasons to generate a link - if you actually want a
document to be widely sharable, this is a great way to get it out there.
However, you should probably never have the link permission set to
anything other than “Anyone with the link can view”.
Most of the time, you’ll know who should be viewing this doc. It might
be a bit of extra work, but you should take the time to explicitly share
your document with the people who actually should have access.
In the section labeled “People” within the sharing menu, you can enter
each person’s email address - separated by commas - to give them all
access together. You can set permissions for each batch of users that
you share with.
In general you should give out the least amount of access possible to
the fewest number of people possible. If someone doesn’t need to edit a
file immediately, try to only give them view access until they have
something specific to change. You can always give them more access
later.

You’re not done! Navigate to the advanced settings by clicking
“Advanced” in the bottom right corner of the menu and check out the two
checkboxes at the bottom under “Owner settings”.

Check “Prevent editors from changing access and adding new people”. This
will ensure that only you, or the accounts given “Owner” access are
allowed to add new people to the document.
Also, click “Disable options to download, print, and copy for commenters
and viewers”. This prevents people from extracting the data from your
document if they only have the lowest levels of access. If you want to
download or copy your document, you should be able to do that for them.
There may be exceptions to both of the above options, but as a general
rule, it’s better to start off too secure and roll it back when you need
to than to realize too late that everyone has access.

### Fixing oversharing
Remove link sharing! This is an important first step, because when link
sharing is enabled, you have no control over who has access to the
links. In the sharing menu, click into the link permissions dropdown and
set it to “OFF - only specific people can access”.

This will revoke access for anyone who has the link but has not been
given access explicitly by the owner of the document.
The next thing you should do is look through the users who still
currently have access to the document. Click the “Advanced” button in
the bottom right corner of the menu, which will show you a list of all
users with their level of access.

You’ll be able to run through everyone and revoke access (by clicking the “X”) or modify their permissions. If there are too many people with
access, the best thing might be to lock everyone out of the document,
and re-add people one by one as they need access.
